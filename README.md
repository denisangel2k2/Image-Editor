This application is an image editing software wrote in Java using JavaFX library for the GUI.

## Achievements
This project strengthened my knowledge about mouse events, processing an image and bug solving. In addition, I managed to make use of the factory and singleton design patterns for the Image processing features, which made me avoid various potential issues with the code along the development process.
